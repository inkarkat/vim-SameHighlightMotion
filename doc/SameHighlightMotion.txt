DESCRIPTION				     *SameHighlightMotion-description*

Vim offers many different powerful motions to position the cursor, but none
leverages the syntactic analysis of the built-in syntax highlighting.

This plugin provides mappings to jump to the borders and next [count]
occurrences of text highlighted in the same effective highlight group as under
the cursor. So you can use the easily discernible distinction of color and
style to navigate and select text. The plugin's functionality can also power
other plugins that provide motions to certain artifacts, like errors or TODO
items.

SEE ALSO								     *

- The |SameSyntaxMotion.vim| plugin (vimscript #4338) provides almost
  identical mappings but looks at the syntax ID. So it includes other
  contained sub-syntaxes (like escape sequences in a string), but stops at an
  adjacent different syntax that is highlighted the same way.

RELATED WORKS								     *

- The SyntaxMotion plugin (vimscript #2965) by Dominique PellÃ© provides very
  similar motions for normal and visual mode, but no operator-pending and text
  objects. It uses same color as the distinguishing property.

==============================================================================
USAGE						   *SameHighlightMotion-usage*

"Same highlighting" in the context of the mappings and text objects means that
the same highlight group is used to highlight the text. Transparent syntax
groups are ignored, highlight links are followed.
Unhighlighted whitespace between identically highlighted items is skipped. So
when there are multiple keywords in a row (FOO BAR BAZ), they are treated as
one area, even though the whitespace between them is not covered by the
highlighting.

   *]h* *]H* *[h* *[H* *v_]h* *v_]H* *v_[h* *v_[H* *o_]h* *o_]H* *o_[h* *o_[H*
]h			Go to [count] next start of the same highlighting.
]H			Go to [count] next end of the same highlighting.
[h			Go to [count] previous start of the same highlighting.
[H			Go to [count] previous end of the same highlighting.
			The 'wrapscan' setting applies.

						       *ah* *v_ah* *ih* *v_ih*
ah			"a highlighting" text object, select [count] same
			highlighting areas.
ih			"inner highlighting" text object, select [count] same
			highlighting areas within the same line. Whitespace
			around the highlighting area is not included.
			Unhighlighted whitespace delimits same syntax items
			here, so this selects individual keywords.

==============================================================================
INSTALLATION				    *SameHighlightMotion-installation*

The code is hosted in a Git repo at
    https://github.com/inkarkat/vim-SameHighlightMotion
You can use your favorite plugin manager, or "git clone" into a directory used
for Vim |packages|. Releases are on the "stable" branch, the latest unstable
development snapshot on "master".

This script is also packaged as a |vimball|. If you have the "gunzip"
decompressor in your PATH, simply edit the *.vmb.gz package in Vim; otherwise,
decompress the archive first, e.g. using WinZip. Inside Vim, install by
sourcing the vimball or via the |:UseVimball| command. >
    vim SameHighlightMotion*.vmb.gz
    :so %
To uninstall, use the |:RmVimball| command.

DEPENDENCIES				    *SameHighlightMotion-dependencies*

- Requires Vim 7.0 or higher.
- Requires the |ingo-library.vim| plugin (vimscript #4433), version 1.044 or
  higher.
- Requires the CountJump plugin (vimscript #3130), version 1.90 or higher.

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION				   *SameHighlightMotion-configuration*

For a permanent configuration, put the following commands into your |vimrc|:
						   *SameHighlightMotion-remap*
To change the default motion mappings, use: >
    let g:SameHighlightMotion_BeginMapping = 'h'
    let g:SameHighlightMotion_EndMapping = 'H'
To also change the [ / ] prefix to something else, follow the instructions for
|CountJump-remap-motions|.

To change the default text object mappings, use: >
    let g:SameHighlightMotion_TextObjectMapping = 'h'
To also change the a prefix to something else, follow the instructions for
|CountJump-remap-text-objects|.

==============================================================================
LIMITATIONS				     *SameHighlightMotion-limitations*

- Because the algorithm has to sequentially inspect every character's
  highlight groups, movement (especially when there's no additional match and
  the search continues to the buffer's border or wraps around) can be
  noticeably slow.
